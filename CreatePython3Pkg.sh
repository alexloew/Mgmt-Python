#!/bin/zsh

# This script is inspired by the MacAdmins Python project: https://github.com/macadmins/python
# which itself was inspired by https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python
#
# What this script will do is generate a package with the following structure:
# |____opt
# | |____mgmt
# | | |____bin
# | | | |____python3 -> /opt/mgmt/frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
# | | |____frameworks
# | | | |____python3.framework
#
# You can either generate a minimal or recommended Python 3 package. The differences are
#   in the modules that are included. Run the script without any parameters to get a list.
# It is expected that your python scripts should use the following shebang:
#       #!/opt/mgmt/bin/python3
#
# The rationale for the choices made here are as follows:
#   "mgmt" is generic and does not reference the name of any specific company/org.
#   "mgmt" is a short acronym that insinuates that it's for management of the computer.
#   It's not commonly used by popular packaging tools like homebrew and won't conflict
#       with MacPorts.
#   It's not part of $PATH which decreases the chances there's a conflict if a user
#       installs their own version of Python 3.
#   It allows us to create a somewhat short symbolic link: /opt/mgmt/bin/python3
#   /opt is protected in macOS 10.15 because the root volume is read-only. Apple is
#       acknowledging this directory is a conventional path used by tools by creating
#       it in 10.15 and not using it themselves/leaving it blank.
#   /opt is hidden in macOS 10.15 by default.
#
# The following considerations were also made:
#
# /usr/local is one location that is often used for personally installed command line
#   tools. However certain tools like homebrew make use of this path and do insist on
#   changing ownership of it. If you support developers in your organization, then it's
#   quite likely they will make use of this path to install many other tools and/or homebrew.
#   It's best just to avoid any potential conflicts. This path is by default not visible to users.
# /Library/CompanyName is another recommendation. The idea here is that you'd have a
#   folder where you keep commonly used company resources, tools, etc. that are relied on
#   for device management. This path is visible to users, but you can certainly hide it if
#   you preferred. The one downside here would be that the path would be a little longer
#   to reference than usual. However you can take care of that by creating a symbolic link
#   in a more traditional path so that it's easier to reference.
# /opt is another path that's been recommended. It exists by default in macOS 10.15, but
#   not in previous versions of macOS. It is hidden by default. MacPorts makes use of
#   /opt/local. However they do not make any such recommendations about changing
#   ownership. The concerns about a potential conflict still exist if you use /opt/local
#   and a developer has installed MacPorts though.
# Some admins have suggested using your company acronym regardless of the directory such
#   as (e.g. /usr/acme or/opt/acme). In 10.15, you cannot write to /usr since it's
#   protected by System Integrity Protection.
# Do you want this version of Python to be available to end-users? If you want this
#   version of Python to be available to end-users then you'll want to aware of what is 
#   available in $PATH. For example, if you created a symbolic link to your Python in
#   /usr/local/bin/python3, then you end up with a situation where the your Python could
#   impact the end user relying on it. Likewise, if you make your python3 available in
#   $PATH and the end user ends up installing Python 3 which is also available in $PATH,
#   you may end up with a conflict with your scripts.
